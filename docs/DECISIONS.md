# Decisions

One entry per decision. A reversal is a new entry that names the one it reverses. Never edit an entry.

Decisions 1 to 12 are stated in full in SPEC.md sections 4 and 5. This file records what changed after the spec was written.

## 13. Boundary rule is a script, not an ESLint plugin (September 4, 2026)

SPEC.md section 8 said an ESLint boundary rule. Milestone 0 uses `tools/check-boundaries.mjs`, forty lines with no dependencies, run as `npm run lint`. Reason: one fewer toolchain to configure and the rule is readable in full. Revisit when a real linter is added.

## 14. Web package excluded from the root typecheck (September 4, 2026)

The Worker compiles against Cloudflare types, not Node types. It has its own tsconfig and is checked by `wrangler` at deploy. The root `npm run typecheck` covers core, db, and pipeline.

## 15. Starter source list is unverified (September 4, 2026)

The build environment could not reach any news host. `config/sources.yaml` ships with the candidate list and `npm run stage -- sources check` exists so the list can be verified locally in one command. Davis owns the list.
